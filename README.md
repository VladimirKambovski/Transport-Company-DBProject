# Transport Company Management System

As part of a course curriculum, our team was developing a management system for transport
companies utilizing a PostgreSQL database for data storage. I was responsible for applying ER
modeling techniques to design the database structure effectively. Additionally, I employed PL/
SQL for developing backend logic within the database, implementing procedures and
functions to enhance system functionality. The system aims to streamline the management of
transport data, encompassing tasks such as routine route planning, ticket reservation, and
performance analysis. By leveraging advanced database technologies and methodologies, 
we aimed to create a robust solution that meets the complex needs of transport companies
efficiently.
